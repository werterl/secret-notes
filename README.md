# Secret Notes

The service allows you to create notes that will be destroyed after reading or by a timer.
The content of the note is encrypted by the browser before being saved to the database.

## How It Works

1. Enter the text of the message and configure access parameters:
    - password access: if a password is set, recipients will need to enter it to view the content; otherwise, it will be generated by the browser.
    - access time: you can set a time limit after which the note will be destroyed.
    - email address: if an email is provided, a notification will be sent to the sender after the content is first accessed.
2. The recipient will receive a notification with a link to the note.
3. The recipient opens the note, enters the password (if required), and views the message.
